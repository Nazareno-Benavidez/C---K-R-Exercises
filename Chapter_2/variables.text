If the variable in question is not automatic, the initialization is done once only, conceptionally before the
program starts executing, and the initializer must be a constant expression. An explicitly initialized automatic
variable is initialized each time the function or block it is in is entered; the initializer may be any expression.
External and static variables are initialized to zero by default. Automatic variables for which is no explicit
initializer have undefined (i.e., garbage) values.

The const declaration can also be used with array arguments, to indicate that the function does not change
that array; i.e.:
int strlen(const char[]);
